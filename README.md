## Program Phase 1: The Tech Training Phase

The first phase of SureStart VAIL is the Tech Training phase, which will last 3.5 weeks. This phase is a self-paced learning phase, in which students working in a team-based learning environment, supported by SureStart mentors, complete 14 technical modules focussed on building foundational AI knowledge and hands-on Machine Learning skills. Besides mentoring from the SureStart mentoring team, trainees will also receive advice, tips and recommendations for experienced academics and industry experts through our Career Pathways seminar series.

The modules are as follows:

__Day 1__: We start the program off with an introduction to machine learning algorithms, and how a state of the art library makes it easy and fun to run on-the-shelf machine learning models for Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest.

__Day 2__: Once we have looked at simpler machine learning models, we come to slightly more powerful AI tools such as Deep Learning models and Tensorflow which is a library in python which helps build deep neural networks as easily as stacking blocks of neural layers.

__Day 3__: While there exist many libraries which make it easy to build many complex neural networks, they sheild us from the inner workings of the same and we get what is a blackbox in to their workings. Today we shall build a simple neural network from scratch and study it.

__Day 4__: Going one step further with neural network architectures, we explore an architecture widely used in Computer Vision tasks, Convolutional Neural Networks. They are known for their ability to compound smaller patterns into larger more humanly-recognizable ones.

__Day 5__: An important part of the learning process of any machine learning algorithm is its loss function or cost function. It maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some "cost" associated with the event. We study loss functions related to Regression based algorithms on this day.

__Day 6__: Progressing from the previous day we come over to losses regarding classification related algorithms on this day. They differ from regression loss functions in as regression loss functions aim at predicting quantities while classificaiton loss functions aim at predicting class and labels.

__Day 7__: The next topic is very connected to the previous topic. We can have a loss/cost function which tells how accurate the given machine learning model is at its prediction, but we need another alogrithm which is able to chagne the weigths of the model to lower the loss/cost function such that our model gets better at its predictions. We call such an algorithm optimizers.

__Day 8__: All neural networks on the basis of their perceptrons/nodes are still very linear in their function. We add intermediate nodes we pass our outputs through in order to add non-linearity and fit our model to more complex problems. Such nodes use what we call activation functions.

__Day 9__: With any machine learning models, what is of the utmost importance is data, and the quality of such data. Based on how and how much we train our models it is possible to make it learn not enough from the data or learn the details rather than the patterns of given data. We learn how to combat such situations on this day.

__Day 10__: We delve futher into how to handle overfitting and underfitting by learning of modifications we can make to our neural network for it. 

__Day 11__: In previous days and even today there are questions on the rammifications of the capabilities of Machine Learning algorithms. As they learn from what data we give them, it is very important to vet what it gets. As it is easier to remove bias from machines than from humans manually. We learn of things to be careful of with the ethics of Machine Learning.

__Day 12__: Another slightly advanced architecture of neural networks is an autoencoder. Unlike previously discussed deep learning algorithms this architecture is unsupervised. Which means we do not give it labels to learn from, but simply the input image. We shall see similar network structure in coming days.

__Day 13__: A slight improvement to the autoencoders gives us the generative adversarial networks. Where we have an encoder which is trained to produce the input data, and an decoder which discerns wether the data it gets is real or generated by the encoder. They essentially train each other to get better at their tasks.

__Day 14__: We have a task, style transfer, which is very connected to generative adversarial networks but differ in one simple way. We shall learn about this difference during this day and more.

## Program Phase 2: The Tech Innovation Phase
During the Innnovation phase of our Virtual AI intensive, the last 1.5 weeks, trainee teams will identify real-world problems, consider the ethical and social implications of the proposed projects, and apply their technical knowledge to innovate and address problems that are of import and impact in their local and global contexts.  Each team will be paired up with a mentor to provide guidance in developing and presenting their Innovation projects.

The final projects will be presented in a Makeathon, in which teams will showcase to a judging panel of experts from industry and academia, and to a global audience of peers, mentors, and potential employers how they applied their technical knowledge to  develop prototypes of AI-based solutions to address social challenges. Winning teams will recieve cash prizes and certificates. 

Prior to 10 AM EST of the first day of Phase 2, we will release the Makeathon theme choices. You will select one of them on which base your Innovation project. All support materials, forms, and judging rubric and expectations will also be shared with it. 

While in this phase, individuals and teams have no specific modules to follow, here are our recommendations:

__Day 15__: Identify Makeathon theme and share back with SureStart using the appropriate form. Begin brainstorm ideas for a social impact problem that is meaningful to your team. Each team member should review the [Makeathon Guide](https://mysurestart.com/s/VAIL-Create-a-thon-Guide.pdf). Continue ideating and brainstorming in your teams. Use the Makeathon Guide to define roles and tasks for each team member. Every team member must have at least 1 primary task that they are leading, and 1-2 tasks that they are supporting. Set up time to meet with your Business Mentors, if you have not already done so.

__Day 16__: Problem and Solution Outline -> Outline what is the primary problem you are going to solve? How you expect to solve it use AI/ML? What do you expect to build? What kind of data you are going to need to build it? Will you build a model or will you use an off-the-shelf model or library? Begin researching both requirements. Start your Deck Development -> Begin by creating a skeleton of the headers.

__The Weekend before__: Continue developing your project. Begin Market Research -> Start by asking who is your work going to benefit (these are your end-users and/or customers)? How are you going to get their input? Have an outreach plan; create surveys and begin setting up interviews. Start reaching out to folks you want to survey/interview. Do your Competitive Landscape Analysis -> Consider who else is solving this problem. What is left unsolved? Why? With this knowledge, refine your proposed solution. Begin your Tech Development -> Start by identifying and acquiring/creating datasets your need; outlining the model you will need to build, or exploring off-the-shelf model or libraries if that is the direction you want to go. Begin building the scaffolding code you will need to implement your solution. Watch some [past SureStart Makeathon winners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9FyCODLflg&list=PLsSCYP2a9mZhAVJLVefDkOskkoW8m_UwH).

__Day 17__: Finish your Competitive Landscape Analysis. Continue to Market Research work. Continue your Tech Development. Start your Deck Development if you have not yet. Begin outlining your Pitch: aka, what you will say during your **5-minute final project presentations**. 

__Day 18__: Finalize the Tech Dev process. Share the **required one page description of your project** using the template provided. Continue all other threads of work. Keep practicing your Pitch.  

__Day 19__: Finish your Market Research. Your Tech and Deck development should be near complete. Keep practicing your Pitch.  

__Day 20__: Finish all threads of work. Keep practicing your Pitch.

__Last day__: Show up 15 minutes before the final presentation. Dress professionally. Present your team project at the Makeathon with confidence and pride. Celebrate successful program completion!
