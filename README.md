## Phase 1

The first 3 weeks will be a self-paced learning phase with the mentoring and support from SureStart, as well as other experienced R&D professionals from other organizations, including top universities.

Day 1: We start the program off with an introduction to machine learning algorithms, and how a state of the art library makes it easy and fun to run on-the-shelf machine learning models for Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest.

Day 2: Once we have looked at simpler machine learning models we come to slightly more powerful AI tools such as Deep Learning models and Tensorflow which is a library in python which helps build deep neural networks as easily as stacking blocks of neural layers.

Day 3: While there exist many libraries which make it easy to build many complex neural networks, they sheild us from the inner workings of the same and we get what is a blackbox in to their workings. Today we shall build a simple neural network from scratch and study it.

Day 4: Going one step further with neural network architectures, we explore an architecture widely used in Computer Vision tasks, Convolutional Neural Networks. They are known for their ability to compound smaller patterns into larger more humanly-recognizable ones.

Day 5: An important part of the learning process of any machine learning algorithm is its loss function or cost function. It maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some "cost" associated with the event. We study loss functions related to Regression based algorithms on this day.

Day 6: Progressing from the previous day we come over to losses regarding Classification related algorithms on this day. They differ from regression loss functions in as regression loss functions aim at predicting quantities while classificaiton loss functions aim at predicting class and labels.

## Phase 2

The last 2 weeks of the program will lead upto a Makeathon where students will apply their learnings from Phase 1 to conduct conduct group-based ideation and creation. The students will work in small teams of 4-5 participants to develop an AI-based solution to a real-world problem for the program Makeathon. Each team will be paired up with a mentor to provide guidance and support thorugh Phase 2.

The final projects created by the students will be presented on the last day of the program to a judging panel of the industry experts from partner tech organizations. Winning teams will recieve cash prizes and participants will recieve certificates of completion.
